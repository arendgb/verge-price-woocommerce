# Verge USD/Price conversion in Woocommerce
This plugin will convert the USD price you put in your products details and convert it real-time in the appropriate XVG price. The conversion will be updated every time the user reloads the page.

This plugin is still in beta and is being tested, so usage is on own risk.

You can download the plugin zip in the release section of this GitHub repo.
